    <P style="color:rgb(0,200,255);">Hello My name is Emma Bautista! I am 15 years old and I am a sophmore attnending PHS, Last year wasn't really my year such as for example, I was currently new to Pasadena High School, But I also knew I had to find myself a way around to get comfortable to the school, As I was a freshman I was not ready to be at a different school because I was not comfortable transitioning to another schhol.</P>
      <P style="color:rgb(116,253,120);">During my first year at PHS, I struggled making new friends because I thought no one would like me until I needed to break myself from being nervous and made my first move making new friends and I made quite a ton of friends! Some worked out, others didn't sucess well as I thought of but people I made friends with were a big success! My friends also helped me get out my social anxiety feeling and made me do a lot of fun things to help me! :) </P>

<P style="color:rgb(116,253,120)">Some of my favorite Interest are making this aesthetic called the Lipstick stain on book, It's basically where you can write anything and use any color lipstick and put it on yourself and put a kiss mark on the book/journal and it will look very pretty, it's usually like my comfort hobbie whenever I feel stress or not okay! </P>
